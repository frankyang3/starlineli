        Our Journey
      </h1>
      <p>
        Starline Li Inc. started in 2011 as a dry seafood importer. Exclusively selling dried seacucumbers and fish maw, both being important traditional theraputic Chinese ingredients and valued highly for its nutrients. After selling these two products for (number of years) years, we started to expand our product offerings. Dried Abalone, and dried sea conch were both added to the list of products we sold and in (the year we selling frozen) we finally began selling frozen seafood such as frozen (list of products). Throughout our history of selling seafood, we have always took pride in the quality of the products we sell. Everything we sell is personally tried and tested. As such, only the best products at the best prices arrive at your door.
